  content: "<p>These terms and conditions (“Agreement”) set forth the general terms
    and conditions of your use of the “Aviator Logbook” mobile application (“Mobile
    Application” or “Service”) and any of its related products and services (collectively,
    “Services”). This Agreement is legally binding between you (“User”, “you” or “your”)
    and Spree Forty Three (“Spree Forty Three”, “we”, “us” or “our”). If you are entering
    into this agreement on behalf of a business or other legal entity, you represent
    that you have the authority to bind such entity to this agreement, in which case
    the terms “User”, “you” or “your” shall refer to such entity. If you do not have
    such authority, or if you do not agree with the terms of this agreement, you must
    not accept this agreement and may not access and use the Mobile Application and
    Services. By accessing and using the Mobile Application and Services, you acknowledge
    that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by the terms of this Agreement.
    You acknowledge that this Agreement is a contract between you and Spree Forty
    Three, even though it is electronic and is not physically signed by you, and it
    governs your use of the Mobile Application and Services.</p>"

  content: "<p>You must be at least 13 years of age to use the Mobile Application
    and Services. By using the Mobile Application and Services and by agreeing to
    this Agreement you warrant and represent that you are at least 13 years of age.
    If you create an account in the Mobile Application, you are responsible for maintaining
    the security of your account and you are fully responsible for all activities
    that occur under the account and any other actions taken in connection with it.
    We may, but have no obligation to, monitor and review new accounts before you
    may sign in and start using the Services. Providing false contact information
    of any kind may result in the termination of your account. You must immediately
    notify us of any unauthorized uses of your account or any other breaches of security.
    We will not be liable for any acts or omissions by you, including any damages
    of any kind incurred as a result of such acts or omissions. We may suspend, disable,
    or delete your account (or any part thereof) if we determine that you have violated
    any provision of this Agreement or that your conduct or content would tend to
    damage our reputation and goodwill. If we delete your account for the foregoing
    reasons, you may not re-register for our Services. We may block your email address
    and Internet protocol address to prevent further registration.</p>"
