  headline: Use and processing of collected information
  content: "<p>We act as a data controller and a data processor in terms of the GDPR
    when handling Personal Information, unless we have entered into a data processing
    agreement with you in which case you would be the data controller and we would
    be the data processor.</p><p>Our role may also differ depending on the specific
    situation involving Personal Information. We act in the capacity of a data controller
    when we ask you to submit your Personal Information that is necessary to ensure
    your access and use of the Services. In such instances, we are a data controller
    because we determine the purposes and means of the processing of Personal Information
    and we comply with data controllers’ obligations set forth in the GDPR.</p><p>We
    act in the capacity of a data processor in situations when you submit Personal
    Information through the Services. We do not own, control, or make decisions about
    the submitted Personal Information, and such Personal Information is processed
    only in accordance with your instructions. In such instances, the User providing
    Personal Information acts as a data controller in terms of the GDPR.</p><p>In
    order to make the Services available to you, or to meet a legal obligation, we
    may need to collect and use certain Personal Information. If you do not provide
    the information that we request, we may not be able to provide you with the requested
    products or services. Any of the information we collect from you may be used for
    the following purposes:</p><p>- Create and manage user accounts</p><p>- Deliver
    products or services</p><p>- Improve products and services</p><p>- Respond to
    inquiries and offer support</p><p>- Improve user experience</p><p>- Enforce terms
    and conditions and policies</p><p>- Protect from abuse and malicious users</p><p>-
    Respond to legal requests and prevent harm</p><p>- Run and operate the Services</p><p>Processing
    your Personal Information depends on how you interact with the Services, where
    you are located in the world and if one of the following applies: (i) you have
    given your consent for one or more specific purposes; this, however, does not
    apply, whenever the processing of Personal Information is subject to California
    Consumer Privacy Act or European data protection law; (ii) provision of information
    is necessary for the performance of an agreement with you and/or for any pre-contractual
    obligations thereof; (iii) processing is necessary for compliance with a legal
    obligation to which you are subject; (iv) processing is related to a task that
    is carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority
    vested in us; (v) processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests
    pursued by us or by a third party. We may also combine or aggregate some of your
    Personal Information in order to better serve you and to improve and update our
    Services.</p><p>We rely on the following legal bases as defined in the GDPR upon
    which we collect and process your Personal Information:</p><p>- User’s consent</p><p>-
    Our own legitimate interests</p><p>Note that under some legislations we may be
    allowed to process information until you object to such processing by opting out,
    without having to rely on consent or any other of the legal bases above. In any
    case, we will be happy to clarify the specific legal basis that applies to the
    processing, and in particular whether the provision of Personal Information is
    a statutory or contractual requirement, or a requirement necessary to enter into
    a contract.</p>"
