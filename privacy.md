    agreement with you in which case you would be the data controller and we would
    be the data processor.</p><p>Our role may also differ depending on the specific
    situation involving Personal Information. We act in the capacity of a data controller
    when we ask you to submit your Personal Information that is necessary to ensure
    your access and use of the Services. In such instances, we are a data controller
    because we determine the purposes and means of the processing of Personal Information

    act in the capacity of a data processor in situations when you submit Personal
    Information through the Services. We do not own, control, or make decisions about

    Personal Information acts as a data controller in terms of the GDPR.</p><p>In
    order to make the Services available to you, or to meet a legal obligation, we
    may need to collect and use certain Personal Information. If you do not provide
    the information that we request, we may not be able to provide you with the requested

    given your consent for one or more specific purposes; this, however, does not
    apply, whenever the processing of Personal Information is subject to California
    Consumer Privacy Act or European data protection law; (ii) provision of information
    is necessary for the performance of an agreement with you and/or for any pre-contractual
    obligations thereof; (iii) processing is necessary for compliance with a legal
    obligation to which you are subject; (iv) processing is related to a task that
    is carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority
    vested in us; (v) processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests
    pursued by us or by a third party. We may also combine or aggregate some of your
    Personal Information in order to better serve you and to improve and update our
    Services.</p><p>We rely on the following legal bases as defined in the GDPR upon
    which we collect and process your Personal Information:</p><p>- User’s consent</p><p>-
    Our own legitimate interests</p><p>Note that under some legislations we may be
    allowed to process information until you object to such processing by opting out,
    without having to rely on consent or any other of the legal bases above. In any
    case, we will be happy to clarify the specific legal basis that applies to the
    processing, and in particular whether the provision of Personal Information is
    a statutory or contractual requirement, or a requirement necessary to enter into
    a contract.</p>"

    adhere to the latest security standards as managed by the PCI Security Standards
    Council, which is a joint effort of brands like Visa, MasterCard, American Express
    and Discover.  Sensitive and private data exchange happens over a SSL secured
    communication channel and is encrypted and protected with digital signatures,
    and the Services are also in compliance with strict vulnerability standards in
    order to create as secure of an environment as possible for Users. We will share
    payment data with the Payment Processors only to the extent necessary for the
    purposes of processing your payments, refunding such payments, and dealing with
    complaints and queries related to such payments and refunds.</p><p>Please note
    that the Payment Processors may collect some Personal Information from you, which
    allows them to process your payments (e.g., your email address, address, credit
    card details, and bank account number) and handle all the steps in the payment
    process through their systems, including data collection and data processing.
    Where necessary for processing future or recurring payments and subject to your
    prior consent, your financial information will be stored in encrypted form on
    secure servers of our Payment Processors. The Payment Processors’ use of your
    Personal Information is governed by their respective privacy policies which may
    or may not contain privacy protections as protective as this Policy. We suggest
    that you review their respective privacy policies.</p>"

    to correct, amend, delete, or limit the use of your Personal Information. If you
    wish to be informed what Personal Information we hold about you and if you want
    it to be removed from our systems, please contact us. In certain circumstances,
    you have the following data protection rights:</p><p>(i) You have the right to
    withdraw consent where you have previously given your consent to the processing
    of your Personal Information. To the extent that the legal basis for our processing
    of your Personal Information is consent, you have the right to withdraw that consent
    at any time. Withdrawal will not affect the lawfulness of processing before the
    withdrawal.</p><p>(ii) You have the right to learn if your Personal Information
    is being processed by us, obtain disclosure regarding certain aspects of the processing,
    and obtain a copy of your Personal Information undergoing processing.</p><p>(iii)
    You have the right to verify the accuracy of your information and ask for it to
    be updated or corrected. You also have the right to request us to complete the
    Personal Information you believe is incomplete.</p><p>(iv) You have the right
    to object to the processing of your information if the processing is carried out
    on a legal basis other than consent. Where Personal Information is processed for
    the public interest, in the exercise of an official authority vested in us, or
    for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by us, you may object to
    such processing by providing a ground related to your particular situation to
    justify the objection.</p><p>(v) You have the right, under certain circumstances,
    to restrict the processing of your Personal Information. These circumstances include:
    the accuracy of your Personal Information is contested by you and we must verify
    its accuracy; the processing is unlawful, but you oppose the erasure of your Personal
    Information and request the restriction of its use instead; we no longer need
    your Personal Information for the purposes of processing, but you require it to
    establish, exercise or defend your legal claims; you have objected to processing
    pending the verification of whether our legitimate grounds override your legitimate
    grounds. Where processing has been restricted, such Personal Information will
    be marked accordingly and, with the exception of storage, will be processed only
    with your consent or for the establishment, to exercise or defense of legal claims,
    for the protection of the rights of another natural, or legal person or for reasons
    of important public interest.</p><p>(vi) You have the right, under certain circumstances,
    to obtain the erasure of your Personal Information from us. These circumstances
    include: the Personal Information is no longer necessary in relation to the purposes
    for which it was collected or otherwise processed; you withdraw consent to consent-based
    processing; you object to the processing under certain rules of applicable data
    protection law; the processing is for direct marketing purposes; and the personal
    data have been unlawfully processed. However, there are exclusions of the right
    to erasure such as where processing is necessary: for exercising the right of
    freedom of expression and information; for compliance with a legal obligation;
    or for the establishment, to exercise or defense of legal claims.</p><p>(vii)
    You have the right to receive your Personal Information that you have provided
    to us in a structured, commonly used, and machine-readable format and, if technically
    feasible, to have it transmitted to another controller without any hindrance from
    us, provided that such transmission does not adversely affect the rights and freedoms
    of others.</p><p>(viii) You have the right to complain to a data protection authority
    about our collection and use of your Personal Information. If you are not satisfied
    with the outcome of your complaint directly with us, you have the right to lodge
    a complaint with your local data protection authority. For more information, please
    contact your local data protection authority in the EEA. This provision is applicable
    provided that your Personal Information is processed by automated means and that
    the processing is based on your consent, on a contract which you are part of,
    or on pre-contractual obligations thereof.</p>"
