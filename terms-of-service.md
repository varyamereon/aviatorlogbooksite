  headline: Terms of service
  content: "<p>These terms and conditions (“Agreement”) set forth the general terms
    and conditions of your use of the “Aviator Logbook” mobile application (“Mobile
    Application” or “Service”) and any of its related products and services (collectively,
    “Services”). This Agreement is legally binding between you (“User”, “you” or “your”)
    and Spree Forty Three (“Spree Forty Three”, “we”, “us” or “our”). If you are entering
    into this agreement on behalf of a business or other legal entity, you represent
    that you have the authority to bind such entity to this agreement, in which case
    the terms “User”, “you” or “your” shall refer to such entity. If you do not have
    such authority, or if you do not agree with the terms of this agreement, you must
    not accept this agreement and may not access and use the Mobile Application and
    Services. By accessing and using the Mobile Application and Services, you acknowledge
    that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by the terms of this Agreement.
    You acknowledge that this Agreement is a contract between you and Spree Forty
    Three, even though it is electronic and is not physically signed by you, and it
    governs your use of the Mobile Application and Services.</p>"

  headline: Accounts and membership
  content: "<p>You must be at least 13 years of age to use the Mobile Application
    and Services. By using the Mobile Application and Services and by agreeing to
    this Agreement you warrant and represent that you are at least 13 years of age.
    If you create an account in the Mobile Application, you are responsible for maintaining
    the security of your account and you are fully responsible for all activities
    that occur under the account and any other actions taken in connection with it.
    We may, but have no obligation to, monitor and review new accounts before you
    may sign in and start using the Services. Providing false contact information
    of any kind may result in the termination of your account. You must immediately
    notify us of any unauthorized uses of your account or any other breaches of security.
    We will not be liable for any acts or omissions by you, including any damages
    of any kind incurred as a result of such acts or omissions. We may suspend, disable,
    or delete your account (or any part thereof) if we determine that you have violated
    any provision of this Agreement or that your conduct or content would tend to
    damage our reputation and goodwill. If we delete your account for the foregoing
    reasons, you may not re-register for our Services. We may block your email address
    and Internet protocol address to prevent further registration.</p>"

  headline: Billing and payments
  content: "<p>You shall pay all fees or charges to your account in accordance with
    the fees, charges, and billing terms in effect at the time a fee or charge is
    due and payable. Where Services are offered on a free trial basis, payment may
    be required after the free trial period ends, and not when you enter your billing
    details (which may be required prior to the commencement of the free trial period).
    If auto-renewal is enabled for the Services you have subscribed for, you will
    be charged automatically in accordance with the term you selected. If, in our
    judgment, your purchase constitutes a high-risk transaction, we will require you
    to provide us with a copy of your valid government-issued photo identification,
    and possibly a copy of a recent bank statement for the credit or debit card used
    for the purchase. We reserve the right to change products and product pricing
    at any time. We also reserve the right to refuse any order you place with us.
    We may, in our sole discretion, limit or cancel quantities purchased per person,
    per household or per order. These restrictions may include orders placed by or
    under the same customer account, the same credit card, and/or orders that use
    the same billing and/or shipping address. In the event that we make a change to
    or cancel an order, we may attempt to notify you by contacting the e-mail and/or
    billing address/phone number provided at the time the order was made.</p>"

  headline: Accuracy of information
  content: "<p>Occasionally there may be information in the Mobile Application that
    contains typographical errors, inaccuracies or omissions that may relate to product
    descriptions, pricing, availability, promotions and offers. We reserve the right
    to correct any errors, inaccuracies or omissions, and to change or update information
    or cancel orders if any information in the Mobile Application or Services is inaccurate
    at any time without prior notice (including after you have submitted your order).
    We undertake no obligation to update, amend or clarify information in the Mobile
    Application including, without limitation, pricing information, except as required
    by law. No specified update or refresh date applied in the Mobile Application
    should be taken to indicate that all information in the Mobile Application or
    Services has been modified or updated.</p>"

  headline: Links to other resources
  content: "<p>Although the Mobile Application and Services may link to other resources
    (such as websites, mobile applications, etc.), we are not, directly or indirectly,
    implying any approval, association, sponsorship, endorsement, or affiliation with
    any linked resource, unless specifically stated herein. We are not responsible
    for examining or evaluating, and we do not warrant the offerings of, any businesses
    or individuals or the content of their resources. We do not assume any responsibility
    or liability for the actions, products, services, and content of any other third
    parties. You should carefully review the legal statements and other conditions
    of use of any resource which you access through a link in the Mobile Application.
    Your linking to any other off-site resources is at your own risk.</p>"
