  content: '<h1>Terms and conditions</h1><p></p><p>These terms and conditions (“Agreement”)
    set forth the general terms and conditions of your use of the “Aviator Logbook”
    mobile application (“Mobile Application” or “Service”) and any of its related
    products and services (collectively, “Services”). This Agreement is legally binding
    between you (“User”, “you” or “your”) and Spree Forty Three (“Spree Forty Three”,
    “we”, “us” or “our”). If you are entering into this agreement on behalf of a business
    or other legal entity, you represent that you have the authority to bind such
    entity to this agreement, in which case the terms “User”, “you” or “your” shall
    refer to such entity. If you do not have such authority, or if you do not agree
    with the terms of this agreement, you must not accept this agreement and may not
    access and use the Mobile Application and Services. By accessing and using the
    Mobile Application and Services, you acknowledge that you have read, understood,
    and agree to be bound by the terms of this Agreement. You acknowledge that this
    Agreement is a contract between you and Spree Forty Three, even though it is electronic
    and is not physically signed by you, and it governs your use of the Mobile Application
    and Services.</p><h2>Accounts and membership</h2><p>You must be at least 13 years
    of age to use the Mobile Application and Services. By using the Mobile Application
    and Services and by agreeing to this Agreement you warrant and represent that
    you are at least 13 years of age. If you create an account in the Mobile Application,
    you are responsible for maintaining the security of your account and you are fully
    responsible for all activities that occur under the account and any other actions
    taken in connection with it. We may, but have no obligation to, monitor and review
    new accounts before you may sign in and start using the Services. Providing false
    contact information of any kind may result in the termination of your account.
    You must immediately notify us of any unauthorized uses of your account or any
    other breaches of security. We will not be liable for any acts or omissions by
    you, including any damages of any kind incurred as a result of such acts or omissions.
    We may suspend, disable, or delete your account (or any part thereof) if we determine
    that you have violated any provision of this Agreement or that your conduct or
    content would tend to damage our reputation and goodwill. If we delete your account
    for the foregoing reasons, you may not re-register for our Services. We may block
    your email address and Internet protocol address to prevent further registration.</p><h2>Billing
    and payments</h2><p>You shall pay all fees or charges to your account in accordance
    with the fees, charges, and billing terms in effect at the time a fee or charge
    is due and payable. Where Services are offered on a free trial basis, payment
    may be required after the free trial period ends, and not when you enter your
    billing details (which may be required prior to the commencement of the free trial
    period). If auto-renewal is enabled for the Services you have subscribed for,
    you will be charged automatically in accordance with the term you selected. If,
    in our judgment, your purchase constitutes a high-risk transaction, we will require
    you to provide us with a copy of your valid government-issued photo identification,
    and possibly a copy of a recent bank statement for the credit or debit card used
    for the purchase. We reserve the right to change products and product pricing
    at any time. We also reserve the right to refuse any order you place with us.
    We may, in our sole discretion, limit or cancel quantities purchased per person,
    per household or per order. These restrictions may include orders placed by or
    under the same customer account, the same credit card, and/or orders that use
    the same billing and/or shipping address. In the event that we make a change to
    or cancel an order, we may attempt to notify you by contacting the e-mail and/or
    billing address/phone number provided at the time the order was made.</p><h2>Accuracy
    of information</h2><p>Occasionally there may be information in the Mobile Application
    that contains typographical errors, inaccuracies or omissions that may relate
    to product descriptions, pricing, availability, promotions and offers. We reserve
    the right to correct any errors, inaccuracies or omissions, and to change or update
    information or cancel orders if any information in the Mobile Application or Services
    is inaccurate at any time without prior notice (including after you have submitted
    your order). We undertake no obligation to update, amend or clarify information
    in the Mobile Application including, without limitation, pricing information,
    except as required by law. No specified update or refresh date applied in the
    Mobile Application should be taken to indicate that all information in the Mobile
    Application or Services has been modified or updated.</p><h2>Links to other resources</h2><p>Although
    the Mobile Application and Services may link to other resources (such as websites,
    mobile applications, etc.), we are not, directly or indirectly, implying any approval,
    association, sponsorship, endorsement, or affiliation with any linked resource,
    unless specifically stated herein. We are not responsible for examining or evaluating,
    and we do not warrant the offerings of, any businesses or individuals or the content
    of their resources. We do not assume any responsibility or liability for the actions,
    products, services, and content of any other third parties. You should carefully
    review the legal statements and other conditions of use of any resource which
    you access through a link in the Mobile Application. Your linking to any other
    off-site resources is at your own risk.</p><h2>Transfer of purchased products</h2><p>Any
    product or subscription purchased shall be tied to an individual user account,
    and may not be used by or transferred to another user account. We may, in exceptional
    circumstances, consider exceptions to this rule, but this shall be at our own
    discretion.</p><h2>Purchases made via the Google Play Store</h2><p>All purchases
    made via the Google Play Store are subject to the Google Play Terms of Service,
    which at the time of writing are available here: <a href="https://play.google.com/about/play-terms/index.html."
    title="https://play.google.com/about/play-terms/index.html." target="_blank">https://play.google.com/about/play-terms/index.html</a>.</p><h2>Purchases
    made via the App Store</h2><p>All purchases made via the App Store are subject
    to the Apple Media Services Terms and Conditions, which at the time of writing
    are available here: <a href="https://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/us/terms.html."
    title="https://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/us/terms.html." target="_blank">https://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/us/terms.html</a>.</p><h2>Intellectual
    property rights</h2><p>“Intellectual Property Rights” means all present and future
    rights conferred by statute, common law or equity in or in relation to any copyright
    and related rights, trademarks, designs, patents, inventions, goodwill and the
    right to sue for passing off, rights to inventions, rights to use, and all other
    intellectual property rights, in each case whether registered or unregistered
    and including all applications and rights to apply for and be granted, rights
    to claim priority from, such rights and all similar or equivalent rights or forms
    of protection and any other results of intellectual activity which subsist or
    will subsist now or in the future in any part of the world. This Agreement does
    not transfer to you any intellectual property owned by Spree Forty Three or third
    parties, and all rights, titles, and interests in and to such property will remain
    (as between the parties) solely with Spree Forty Three. All trademarks, service
    marks, graphics and logos used in connection with the Mobile Application and Services,
    are trademarks or registered trademarks of Spree Forty Three or its licensors.
    Other trademarks, service marks, graphics and logos used in connection with the
    Mobile Application and Services may be the trademarks of other third parties.
    Your use of the Mobile Application and Services grants you no right or license
    to reproduce or otherwise use any of Spree Forty Three or third party trademarks.</p><h2>Disclaimer
    of warranty</h2><p>You agree that such Service is provided on an “as is” and “as
    available” basis and that your use of the Mobile Application and Services is solely
    at your own risk. We expressly disclaim all warranties of any kind, whether express
    or implied, including but not limited to the implied warranties of merchantability,
    fitness for a particular purpose and non-infringement. We make no warranty that
    the Services will meet your requirements, or that the Service will be uninterrupted,
    timely, secure, or error-free; nor do we make any warranty as to the results that
    may be obtained from the use of the Service or as to the accuracy or reliability
    of any information obtained through the Service or that defects in the Service
    will be corrected. You understand and agree that any material and/or data downloaded
    or otherwise obtained through the use of Service is done at your own discretion
    and risk and that you will be solely responsible for any damage or loss of data
    that results from the download of such material and/or data. We make no warranty
    regarding any goods or services purchased or obtained through the Service or any
    transactions entered into through the Service unless stated otherwise. No advice
    or information, whether oral or written, obtained by you from us or through the
    Service shall create any warranty not expressly made herein.</p><h2>Limitation
    of liability</h2><p>To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, in no event
    will Spree Forty Three, its affiliates, directors, officers, employees, agents,
    suppliers or licensors be liable to any person for any indirect, incidental, special,
    punitive, cover or consequential damages (including, without limitation, damages
    for lost profits, revenue, sales, goodwill, use of content, impact on business,
    business interruption, loss of anticipated savings, loss of business opportunity)
    however caused, under any theory of liability, including, without limitation,
    contract, tort, warranty, breach of statutory duty, negligence or otherwise, even
    if the liable party has been advised as to the possibility of such damages or
    could have foreseen such damages. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable
    law, the aggregate liability of Spree Forty Three and its affiliates, officers,
    employees, agents, suppliers and licensors relating to the services will be limited
    to an amount no greater than one dollar or any amounts actually paid in cash by
    you to Spree Forty Three for the prior one month period prior to the first event
    or occurrence giving rise to such liability. The limitations and exclusions also
    apply if this remedy does not fully compensate you for any losses or fails of
    its essential purpose.</p><h2>Severability</h2><p>All rights and restrictions
    contained in this Agreement may be exercised and shall be applicable and binding
    only to the extent that they do not violate any applicable laws and are intended
    to be limited to the extent necessary so that they will not render this Agreement
    illegal, invalid or unenforceable. If any provision or portion of any provision
    of this Agreement shall be held to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable by a court
    of competent jurisdiction, it is the intention of the parties that the remaining
    provisions or portions thereof shall constitute their agreement with respect to
    the subject matter hereof, and all such remaining provisions or portions thereof
    shall remain in full force and effect.</p><h2>Assignment</h2><p>You may not assign,
    resell, sub-license or otherwise transfer or delegate any of your rights or obligations
    hereunder, in whole or in part, without our prior written consent, which consent
    shall be at our own sole discretion and without obligation; any such assignment
    or transfer shall be null and void. We are free to assign any of its rights or
    obligations hereunder, in whole or in part, to any third party as part of the
    sale of all or substantially all of its assets or stock or as part of a merger.</p><h2>Changes
    and amendments</h2><p>We reserve the right to modify this Agreement or its terms
    related to the Mobile Application and Services at any time at our discretion.
    When we do, we will revise the updated date at the bottom of this page, post a
    notification in the Mobile Application. We may also provide notice to you in other
    ways at our discretion, such as through the contact information you have provided.</p><p>An
    updated version of this Agreement will be effective immediately upon the posting
    of the revised Agreement unless otherwise specified. Your continued use of the
    Mobile Application and Services after the effective date of the revised Agreement
    (or such other act specified at that time) will constitute your consent to those
    changes.</p><h2>Acceptance of these terms</h2><p>You acknowledge that you have
    read this Agreement and agree to all its terms and conditions. By accessing and
    using the Mobile Application and Services you agree to be bound by this Agreement.
