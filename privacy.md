  headline: Use and processing of collected information
  content: "<p>We act as a data controller and a data processor in terms of the GDPR
    when handling Personal Information, unless we have entered into a data processing
    agreement with you in which case you would be the data controller and we would
    be the data processor.</p><p>Our role may also differ depending on the specific
    situation involving Personal Information. We act in the capacity of a data controller
    when we ask you to submit your Personal Information that is necessary to ensure
    your access and use of the Services. In such instances, we are a data controller
    because we determine the purposes and means of the processing of Personal Information
    and we comply with data controllers’ obligations set forth in the GDPR.</p><p>We
    act in the capacity of a data processor in situations when you submit Personal
    Information through the Services. We do not own, control, or make decisions about
    the submitted Personal Information, and such Personal Information is processed
    only in accordance with your instructions. In such instances, the User providing
    Personal Information acts as a data controller in terms of the GDPR.</p><p>In
    order to make the Services available to you, or to meet a legal obligation, we
    may need to collect and use certain Personal Information. If you do not provide
    the information that we request, we may not be able to provide you with the requested
    products or services. Any of the information we collect from you may be used for
    the following purposes:</p><p>- Create and manage user accounts</p><p>- Deliver
    products or services</p><p>- Improve products and services</p><p>- Respond to
    inquiries and offer support</p><p>- Improve user experience</p><p>- Enforce terms
    and conditions and policies</p><p>- Protect from abuse and malicious users</p><p>-
    Respond to legal requests and prevent harm</p><p>- Run and operate the Services</p><p>Processing
    your Personal Information depends on how you interact with the Services, where
    you are located in the world and if one of the following applies: (i) you have
    given your consent for one or more specific purposes; this, however, does not
    apply, whenever the processing of Personal Information is subject to California
    Consumer Privacy Act or European data protection law; (ii) provision of information
    is necessary for the performance of an agreement with you and/or for any pre-contractual
    obligations thereof; (iii) processing is necessary for compliance with a legal
    obligation to which you are subject; (iv) processing is related to a task that
    is carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority
    vested in us; (v) processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests
    pursued by us or by a third party. We may also combine or aggregate some of your
    Personal Information in order to better serve you and to improve and update our
    Services.</p><p>We rely on the following legal bases as defined in the GDPR upon
    which we collect and process your Personal Information:</p><p>- User’s consent</p><p>-
    Our own legitimate interests</p><p>Note that under some legislations we may be
    allowed to process information until you object to such processing by opting out,
    without having to rely on consent or any other of the legal bases above. In any
    case, we will be happy to clarify the specific legal basis that applies to the
    processing, and in particular whether the provision of Personal Information is
    a statutory or contractual requirement, or a requirement necessary to enter into
    a contract.</p>"

  headline: Payment processing
  content: "<p>In case of Services requiring payment, you may need to provide your
    credit card details or other payment account information, which will be used solely
    for processing payments. We use third-party payment processors (“Payment Processors”)
    to assist us in processing your payment information securely.</p><p>Payment Processors
    adhere to the latest security standards as managed by the PCI Security Standards
    Council, which is a joint effort of brands like Visa, MasterCard, American Express
    and Discover.  Sensitive and private data exchange happens over a SSL secured
    communication channel and is encrypted and protected with digital signatures,
    and the Services are also in compliance with strict vulnerability standards in
    order to create as secure of an environment as possible for Users. We will share
    payment data with the Payment Processors only to the extent necessary for the
    purposes of processing your payments, refunding such payments, and dealing with
    complaints and queries related to such payments and refunds.</p><p>Please note
    that the Payment Processors may collect some Personal Information from you, which
    allows them to process your payments (e.g., your email address, address, credit
    card details, and bank account number) and handle all the steps in the payment
    process through their systems, including data collection and data processing.
    Where necessary for processing future or recurring payments and subject to your
    prior consent, your financial information will be stored in encrypted form on
    secure servers of our Payment Processors. The Payment Processors’ use of your
    Personal Information is governed by their respective privacy policies which may
    or may not contain privacy protections as protective as this Policy. We suggest
    that you review their respective privacy policies.</p>"

    Personal Information in our records for the duration necessary to comply with
    our obligations to our affiliates and partners, and for the purposes described
    below. If you would like to delete your Personal Information or permanently delete
    your account, you can do so on the settings page of your account on the Services

    them to use or disclose any of the provided information for their own marketing
    or other purposes.</p><p>We may also disclose any Personal Information we collect,
    use or receive if required or permitted by law, such as to comply with a subpoena
    or similar legal process, and when we believe in good faith that disclosure is
    necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety of others,
    investigate fraud, or respond to a government request.</p><p>In the event we go
    through a business transition, such as a merger or acquisition by another company,
    or sale of all or a portion of its assets, your user account, and your Personal
    Information will likely be among the assets transferred.</p>"
